# CloudPages UI Engineer Test

## Overview

This test includes a user story (UserStory.md) and a wireframe (Wireframe.png). These will serve as requirements for a fictitious feature you must build. **This test is not meant to be finished**, nor is it pass/fail. Simply do your best and do what you can.

The user story includes all requirements for the given feature, ranked by priority. Priority is important here. You **must** build the feature in priority order.

The wireframe is a lo-fi mockup of the UI the feature should include. You are not required to dress up the UI in any way, however, doing so will garner bonus points if it's awesome. Though, don't think a sweet UI will help if the primary requirements of the user story aren't met. :)

Please read the user story and review the wireframe to make sure you understand the requirements before beginning the test. Once you make your initial commit, the timer is set for 48 hours.

Follow **ALL** of the following rules.

## Here are the guidelines for the test:
+ **This test is not meant to be finished.** Speed is not being evaluated, your coding skills are.
+ **Only the first 48 hours will be considered as part of your evaluation.**
+ Fork this repository, do your work; commit early/often with descriptive messages. When finished, send a pull request.
+ Make sure you build the feature **exactly** as the user story directs. Priority is important here.
+ Comments are encouraged to highlight your rationale for your work. Remember: **you have only 48 hours**.
+ You may use any JavaScript and/or CSS library you wish, or none at all.
+ You may use any external or inline JavaScript file(s).
+ Unit tests are **required** and should be included in a "tests" folder. You are required to provide 100% test coverage of all public methods you write. Your unit tests will be reviewed so, put your best foot forward.
+ The files in the "data" folder contain data your code should consume for lists, etc.
+ All code you write **must** run without errors on the following browsers (IE 10/9, FF latest, Chrome latest).

## First task to be completed
+ In the root of the project, create a timestamp.txt file.
+ In that file, include the following on a single line: Start Time: [timestamp] <-- the date/time you started the test.
+ Commit this file. Your first commit must be of this file and this file only.
+ The 48 hour timer begins after you commit your meta.txt file with timestamp.

## Bonus point opportunities:
+ Using BackboneJS, UnderscoreJS and Marionette well.
+ Using [FuelUX](http://getfuelux.com/).
+ Including grunt tooling to lint, test and build your repo.
+ Adding some hot sauce to the UI look and feel.
